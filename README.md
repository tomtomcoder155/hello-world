# hello-world
This is the first repository I will make
Im 35 and recently got into this pretty little thing called coding.
I have stepped into the deep end by purchasing several Udemy courses,
and I am really having a blast learning Python3. The goal I have set
for myself is to learn and grow as fast as possible so that I can start
working in the tech, and more pointedly, the program developer industry.
